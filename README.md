Code from "FMRFamide-like peptides expand the behavioral repertoire of a densely connected nervous system"
Lee, J., Shih, P., Schaedel, O., Rogers, A.K., Quintero-Cadena, P., and Sternberg, P.W. (2017)

Analyses include PCA, GO analysis, KEGG analysis, violin plotting, fuzzy clustering, and heatmapping

Raw RNA-seq reads have been deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (accession number SRP116980)

Each download folder includes an R script, as well as an "input" (and sometimes "output") folders. The "input" folder contains the data that is read into R.
